The JVDT-7 System: A Complete Compendium
Core Principles, Developmental Frameworks, Diagnostic Tools, and Facilitation Guides
This document outlines the complete architecture of the JVDT-7 system, a 7-axis model of cognitive and moral development designed to map the journey from knowledge to wisdom.
Part 1: The Core Philosophy & First Principles
A. The Two Guiding Formulas
	•	The Knowledge Formula: Information + Integration = Knowledge
	•	The Wisdom Formula: Knowledge + Practice = Wisdom
B. The Three Core Values
The system's moral framework is guided by three core values, with the third emerging from the balance of the first two:
	•	Love (Compassion, Empathy, Mercy)
	•	Respect (Justice, Fairness, Principle)
	•	Happiness (Joy, Peace, Harmony) - The resulting equilibrium.
C. The Seven Axes of Development
The JVDT-7 model is built on seven developmental axes, each representing a core faculty of conscience and cognition.
	•	Perception (A ↔ N): Associative vs. Analytical
	•	Interpretation (R ↔ C): Root vs. Context
	•	Reflection (I ↔ E): Internal vs. External
	•	Application (D ↔ P): Idealistic vs. Pragmatic
	•	Motivation (S ↔ M): Self-Directed vs. Mutual-Directed
	•	Orientation (T ↔ H): Temporal vs. Holistic
	•	Value Expression (L ↔ R): Love vs. Respect
D. First Principles: 10 Core Theses
	•	Personhood before profile. JVDT-7 maps faculties of conscience and cognition; it does not fix identity.
	•	Knowing is moral. Epistemology and ethics are inseparable: knowledge tends toward good via practice.
	•	Two equations govern growth. Information + Integration = Knowledge; Knowledge + Practice = Wisdom.
	•	Seven faculties. Perception, Interpretation, Reflection, Application, Motivation, Orientation, Value Expression.
	•	Virtue formation. Each axis matures through habits (arete), not mere preference.
	•	Developmental trajectory. Learners move from novice → competent → proficient → expert → wise.
	•	Dialectical pairs. Every axis is a tension that should be harmonized, not “won.”
	•	Context matters. Classrooms and communities bias axes; design must counterbalance, not amplify bias.
	•	Telemetry over taxonomy. Types are snapshots; growth vectors are the point.
	•	Christ-shaped telos. For this system: Love, Respect, and Joy (Happiness) crown wisdom.
Part 2: The JVDT-7 Axis Deep Dives
Detailed breakdown of each axis, its theoretical anchors, and its developmental path.
1) PERCEPTION — A ↔ N (Association ↔ Analysis)
	•	Essence: How awareness first takes hold of reality (pattern/analogy vs. structure/evidence).
	•	Anchors:
	•	Classical: Aristotle (aisthesis & nous), Augustine (illumination, love shapes sight).
	•	Modern: Jung (intuition vs. sensing), Polanyi (tacit knowledge), Kahneman (System 1/2).
	•	Virtue & Shadow:
	•	A-virtue: Attunement; shadow: credulity, over-reading.
	•	N-virtue: Clarity; shadow: reductionism, coldness.
	•	Development: Novice over-relies on one pole; expert can switch lenses on demand.
	•	Signals: A-leaners recall stories; N-leaners ask for definitions and rubrics.
	•	Practices: Dual-entry notes (story ↔ schema), evidence logs, analogy drills, counter-example hunts.
2) INTERPRETATION — R ↔ C (Root ↔ Context)
	•	Essence: Where meaning anchors (first principles) vs. situates (systems, ecology).
	•	Anchors:
	•	Classical: Aquinas (principia; causes), Augustine (order of loves).
	•	Modern: Vygotsky (context; mediation), Bronfenbrenner (ecological systems), Systems thinking.
	•	Virtue & Shadow:
	•	R-virtue: Fidelity; shadow: rigidity, anachronism.
	•	C-virtue: Relevance; shadow: relativism, drift.

	•	Signals: R-questions “Where does this come from?”; C-questions “What does it depend on?”
	•	Practices: Origin tracing, timeline + map overlays, transfer tasks across contexts.
3) REFLECTION — I ↔ E (Internal ↔ External)
	•	Essence: How comprehension is consolidated: solitude/synthesis vs. dialogue/teaching.
	•	Anchors:

	•	Signals: D talks outcomes for people; P talks KPIs and checklists.
	•	Practices: Impact hypotheses, pilot labs, pre-mortems, A/B practice logs.
5) MOTIVATION — S ↔ M (Self-Directed ↔ Mutual-Directed)
	•	Essence: Why we pursue wisdom: autonomy/mastery vs. service/belonging.

Part 5: The Facilitator's Companion
This is the guide for mentors, teachers, and parents on how to use the JVDT-7 system effectively and pastorally.
1. Purpose
This tool helps a facilitator:
	•	Notice a learner’s current axis stage (Instinct → Wisdom).
	•	Choose suitable prompts from the coaching sets.
	•	Track movement across time without reducing identity to a score.
2. Facilitator's Posture
Guiding reflection, not grading personality.
Do
Don't
Listen more than speak.
Diagnose or label personality.
Ask “Tell me more…” follow-ups.
Rush to advice.
Mirror the learner’s language.
Impose jargon or theology.
Celebrate small integrations.
Treat reflection as compliance.
3. Session Flow (≈15–25 min)
Phase
Purpose
Sample Questions
1 – Warm-Up
Build rapport, set safety.
“What’s one moment of learning or challenge this week?”
2 – Axis Focus
Choose 1-2 axes showing tension.
“Today let’s explore how you see or apply knowledge.”
3 – Prompt Work
Ask 1-2 questions from ladder stage.
“How can you connect today’s effort to your bigger story?”
4 – Integration
Link insight to next action.
“What will you try differently this week?”
5 – Record & Bless
Note key phrase; affirm learner.
“I heard you say you want to balance fairness and care. That’s wisdom forming.”
4. Simple Scoring / Tracking
Use color or symbol instead of numbers to avoid grade mentality.
Stage
Descriptor
Symbol
Evidence Example
1 Instinct
Reactive, unaware of polarity.
⚪
“I just do it; I don’t know why.”
2 Awareness
Names preference or bias.
🟢
“I’m more story-than-numbers.”
3 Balance
Begins to integrate both poles.
🔵
“I used both examples and data.”
4 Mastery
Applies integration consistently.
🟣
“I plan vision and checkpoints.”
5 Wisdom
Models virtue; teaches others.
⭐
“I helped peers find balance.”
Recording Template (one line per axis):
| Axis | Stage | Quote / Behaviour | Next Step | Date |
| :--------- | :-------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------- | :--------- |
| Perception | 🔵 Balance | “Used story & chart to explain.” | Gather feedback examples. | 2025-10-23 |
5. Interpretation Principles
	•	Growth is non-linear. Movement between stages is seasonal; stress may regress axes temporarily.
	•	Strength ≠ maturity. A learner may excel in an axis technically but lack moral integration (Wisdom stage).
	•	Axes interact. When one matures, others often follow (e.g., deeper Reflection enriches Application).
	•	Celebrate awareness. Stage 2 is already progress; curiosity is conversion.
	•	End every session with hope. “You’re learning to steer, not to fit a type.”
6. Reflection Tracking Sheet (weekly mini-log)
Week
Axis 1–7 quick icons
Insight of the week
Small experiment
Joy indicator (1–5 😊)
1
⚪🟢🟢🔵🟢🟢🟢
“I noticed I plan but forget why.”
Link daily plan to purpose.
😊😊😊
2
🔵🔵🟣🟢🔵🔵🟢
“Talking ideas out helps clarity.”
Add 5 min debrief talk.
😊😊😊😊
Joy indicator = internal peace, enthusiasm, gratitude — the moral thermometer of wisdom.




7. Facilitator's Dialogue Pattern (Socratic-pastoral hybrid)
	•	Observe — “I saw you… / You mentioned…”
	•	Name tension — “What happens when you try the opposite approach?”
	•	Invite story — “Tell me about a time that worked.”
	•	Mirror value — “That shows respect / love / courage.”
	•	Commit small action — “One experiment for next week?”
	•	Affirm — “That’s wisdom forming in real time.”
8. Group or Class Application
Format
Frequency
Focus
Weekly reflection circle
10 min
Choose one axis for all; share 1 sentence answers.
Monthly mentor meeting
20 min × student
Use individual ladders.
Quarterly portfolio review
30 min
Compare past entries; highlight 1–2 growth stories.
9. Optional Digital Dashboard Logic
	•	Each axis = color bar (Instinct ⚪ → Wisdom ⭐).
	•	Dashboard averages stages; overlay Joy indicator.
	•	Goal: visualize balance, not rank.

B. The 8 Macro-Family Descriptions
Used for the "Your Macro-Family" section of the report.
1. Root-Seekers (A-R)
	•	Tagline: Hold the roots; grow toward light.
	•	Description: Root-Seekers are custodians of continuity. They learn through depth before breadth—asking where something began and what principle sustains it. They distrust novelty unmoored from essence and often feel responsible for guarding the moral or intellectual foundations of a community. When mature, they translate heritage into guidance; when immature, they risk rigidity or nostalgia.
	•	Core Virtue: Fidelity — loyalty to truth across changing contexts.
	•	Inner Question: “What endures beneath the surface?”
2. Integrators (A-C)
	•	Tagline: Connection creates comprehension.
	•	Description: Integrators are bridge-builders. They perceive relationships faster than boundaries and instinctively seek harmony between people, ideas, and systems. Learning for them is social: truth emerges in conversation and cooperation. They create the atmosphere in which understanding can flourish. When mature, they reconcile opposites; when immature, they blur them.
	•	Core Virtue: Harmony — holding difference together in creative tension.
	•	Inner Question: “How can we bring these parts into one living whole?”
3. Analyst-Builders (N-R)
	•	Tagline: Blueprints that stand the test of time.
	•	Description: Analyst-Builders construct the frameworks that make meaning durable. They delight in systems, measurement, and logical coherence. For them, order is beauty. They turn abstractions into functioning structures—curricula, organizations, or machines—that others can trust. When mature, they design with humility; when immature, they idolize control.
	•	Core Virtue: Order — bringing stability through understanding.
	•	Inner Question: “How do the parts fit so that truth can operate reliably?”
4. Contextual Innovators (N-C)
	•	Tagline: Relevance without compromise.
	•	Description: Contextual Innovators are translators of truth for their own generation. They read environments quickly and adapt ideas to meet new realities. Change excites them because it reveals fresh possibilities. They live at the frontier between heritage and innovation. When mature, they reform without rebellion; when immature, they chase novelty for its own sake.
	•	Core Virtue: Creativity — renewing the familiar through imagination.
	•	Inner Question: “How must truth look to speak meaningfully now?”
5. Visionary Connectors (Complex: e.g., A-R/C-E-D-M-H-L)
	•	Tagline: Speak light into possibility.
	•	Description: Visionary Connectors are storytellers of transformation. They sense potential in people and situations and use language, art, or leadership to awaken it. They learn best through dialogue charged with purpose and emotion. Their presence motivates others to act. When mature, they become catalytic mentors; when immature, they inspire without follow-through.
	•	Core Virtue: Inspiration — awakening hope and courage in others.
6. Reflective Strategists (Complex: e.g., N-C/R-I-P-S-H-R)
	•	Tagline: Order in thought, grace in time.
	•	Description: Reflective Strategists unite contemplation with planning. They analyse causes, anticipate consequences, and move with deliberate timing. Their learning style is cyclic: observe, reflect, plan, execute, review. When mature, they become wise stewards of timing; when immature, they stall in over-analysis.
	•	Core Virtue: Prudence — choosing the right action at the right moment.
7. Collaborative Creators (Complex: e.g., A-C-E-D/P-M-H-L/R)
	•	Tagline: We grow by growing others.
	•	Description: Collaborative Creators believe knowledge blossoms in community. They are energised by teamwork, shared learning, and service. Their classrooms, studios, and workplaces hum with inclusion and laughter. They translate wisdom into belonging. When mature, they create transformative teams; when immature, they avoid conflict.
	•	Core Virtue: Generosity — giving time, skill, and encouragement freely.
8. Principled Pioneers (Complex: e.g., N-R-E/I-D/P-S-T-R)
	•	Tagline: Courage anchored in conviction.
	•	Description: Principled Pioneers combine integrity with initiative. They question assumptions, defend conscience, and blaze trails where truth demands new expression. Their learning is forged in struggle—they grow by standing firm. When mature, they model moral leadership; when immature, they isolate themselves in certainty.
	•	Core Virtue: Courage — acting on conviction despite resistance.
C. The 14 Axis-Card Microtexts
Used to auto-assemble the detailed "Personal Report."
	•	PERCEP_Assoc (A): You perceive through patterns, story, and atmosphere. Meaning arises first in intuition and relationship. You absorb whole pictures, sensing emotional truth before logic. Your challenge is to test instinct with evidence so imagination matures into insight grounded in reality.
	•	PERCEP_Anal (N): You perceive through definition, precision, and proof. Structure and data clarify your world. You dissect complexity until each part makes sense. Your challenge is to trust intuition sooner—allow discovery to precede verification so analysis serves creativity rather than replaces it.
	•	INTERP_Root (R): You seek the essence behind appearances. Origins and causes fascinate you; tradition feels like a moral compass. You learn by asking why. Growth comes when you let context reshape application so ancient truth continues to breathe in the present.
	•	INTERP_Context (C): You see truth as situational and dynamic. Application across environments matters more than origin. You learn by asking how and where. Growth comes when you tether adaptability to enduring principles so relevance doesn’t become relativism.
	•	REFLEC_Internal (I): Understanding deepens in solitude. You digest before you speak, and insight feels sacred until expressed. Silence organises your thoughts into coherence. Growth comes by sharing drafts of ideas earlier—dialogue turns private wisdom into communal growth.
	•	REFLEC_External (E): Understanding crystallises in communication. Talking, teaching, or debating reveals what you know. Interaction brings clarity. Growth comes by practising stillness so expression draws from depth, not momentum.
	•	APPLIC_Ideal (D): You move through vision and meaning. Purpose fuels persistence; projects must matter morally. You reform systems to reflect conscience. Growth comes by mastering logistics—let procedure protect passion so ideals endure beyond inspiration.
	•	APPLIC_Prag (P): You move through method and precision. Order brings peace; outcomes prove worth. You build reliability around purpose. Growth comes by re-igniting imagination—let meaning steer efficiency so progress remains human.
	•	MOTIV_Self (S): Autonomy drives you. You set internal standards and measure success by integrity. Independence keeps your learning alive. Growth comes by embracing partnership—collaboration multiplies personal excellence into collective transformation.
	•	MOTIV_Mutual (M): Belonging drives you. Shared purpose sustains effort. You flourish where contribution meets connection. Growth comes by strengthening individual conviction—serve from strength, not compliance, so empathy retains direction.
	•	ORIENT_Temp (T): You live in milestones and measurable progress. Deadlines energise focus; rhythm breeds trust. You master time through sequence. Growth comes by widening perspective—lift your eyes from the clock to the horizon so pace gains purpose.
	•	ORIENT_Holist (H): You live in seasons and synthesis. Perspective precedes detail; meaning shapes rhythm. You master time through story. Growth comes by narrowing focus—translate vision into immediate steps so depth becomes delivery.
	•	VALUE_Love (L): You lead through empathy and restoration. People feel safe and seen in your presence. Compassion is your first instinct. Growth comes by pairing tenderness with courage—boundaries protect the very love that inspires them.
	•	VALUE_Respect (R): You lead through fairness and consistency. People trust your reliability and justice. Integrity is your language of care. Growth comes by tempering principle with warmth—mercy completes the truth you guard.
